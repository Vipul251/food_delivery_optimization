🍽️ Food Delivery Optimization System
An AI-powered smart dispatch & routing platform using FAISS, OSRM, and Reinforcement Learning

🚀 Overview
The Food Delivery Optimization System is a real-time, scalable, and intelligent solution developed for FoodNest Technologies. It focuses on automating and optimizing food order assignment and delivery routing using modern AI techniques. The system combines:

FAISS for nearest-rider search

Reinforcement Learning (RL) for adaptive learning

OSRM for optimized routing

Streamlit for interactive visualization

FastAPI for backend APIs

It is built to simulate and improve delivery logistics, minimize order delays, and ensure faster and smarter decision-making.

✨ Features
✅ Order-to-Rider Assignment
Uses FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) to find the nearest available rider for each incoming food order instantly.

🚦 Route Optimization
Leverages OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) to determine the fastest and most efficient delivery paths.

🧠 Reinforcement Learning Integration
Trains an RL model over time to optimize order dispatching and minimize delivery times dynamically.

📊 Interactive Dashboard
Real-time visualization and control panel using Streamlit for monitoring active orders and delivery progress.

⚙️ FastAPI Backend
Built-in RESTful APIs using FastAPI to connect frontend interfaces, mobile apps, or third-party systems.

🧪 Synthetic Data Generation
Realistic rider and order datasets are programmatically generated to test, train, and evaluate the system.

🚴‍♂️ How It Works
Step	Module	Description
1️⃣	Order Matching	FAISS quickly retrieves nearest riders based on location vectors
2️⃣	Routing	OSRM computes optimal route considering road network
3️⃣	Learning	RL model learns to improve assignment logic over time
4️⃣	Monitoring	Dashboard updates delivery assignments and rider status live

🔮 Future Enhancements
📍 Traffic-Aware Routing: Incorporate live GPS and traffic feeds to adjust ETAs.

📈 Demand Forecasting: Use historical trends and weather/holiday data to predict order spikes.

🚚 Batch Delivery Support: Assign multiple orders per rider based on zone clustering.

☁️ Cloud Deployment: Host on AWS/GCP/Azure for horizontal scaling and multi-city rollout.
