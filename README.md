Food Delivery Optimization System:

 Overview:
 
The Food Delivery Optimization System is an AI-powered solution for optimizing food order assignments and delivery routes. This system uses FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for fast nearest-neighbor search and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to improve order dispatching and routing over time. The system is designed for FoodNest Technologies and focuses on real-time efficiency, scalability, and intelligent decision-making.

 Features
* Order-to-Rider Assignment: Uses FAISS to quickly match food orders with the nearest available riders.

* Route Optimization: Optimizes delivery paths with OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) for efficient navigation.

* Reinforcement Learning: Trains an RL model to minimize delivery time and improve efficiency.

* Interactive Dashboard: Built using Streamlit for real-time visualization of deliveries.

* API Integration: FastAPI-based backend for seamless API interaction.

* Synthetic Data Generation: Creates realistic order and rider datasets for testing and model training.

üîß Installation

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/food_delivery_optimization.git
cd food_delivery_optimization

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Application

Start the API Backend (FastAPI)

uvicorn app.api:app --reload

Launch the Streamlit Dashboard

streamlit run app/dashboard.py

üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How It Works

Order-Rider Matching: FAISS finds the nearest available rider for each order.

Route Optimization: The best delivery route is computed using OSRM.

Learning & Improvement: The RL model adapts over time to minimize delays.

Real-Time Monitoring: The Streamlit dashboard displays live updates of orders and deliveries.

üìå Future Enhancements
Traffic-Aware Routing using real-time GPS data.

Demand Prediction using historical data to predict high-demand periods.
Multi-Rider Assignments for batch deliveries.

Cloud Deployment for scalability.
